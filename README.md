Just want to let you know if you don't know how to install dependencies, you can install it this way. 
Activate your internet connection first. 
And the Makefile script by using the `make` command. 
The script will install its own dependencies.
```bash
$ make
```

This is why, In order to be able to retrieve assets from the assets folder.
If you don't do that, the assets won't appear on the screen later.
